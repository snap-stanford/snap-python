Snap.py 6.0 Release Notes
December 2020

Snap.py is a Python interface for SNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Platform).
SNAP is a general purpose, high performance system for analysis and
manipulation of large networks. SNAP is written in C++ and optimized
for maximum performance and compact graph representation. It easily scales
to massive networks with hundreds of millions of nodes, and billions of edges.
Snap.py provides performance benefits of SNAP, combined with flexibility
of Python. Most of the SNAP functionality is available via Snap.py in Python.

Snap.py 6.0 is a major release with a large number of new features, most
notably a significantly improved way to call Snap.py functions in Python, a
NetworkX compatibility layer, standard Python functions to handle SNAP vector
and hash types, new functions for egonets and graph union, and a completely
revised package building infrastructure. These enhancements are backward
compatible, so existing Snap.py based programs should continue to work.

A high-level description of changes in Snap.py releases is provided below.
