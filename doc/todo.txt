Proposed Features
Apr 20, 2016

- Remove AddNode(NodeI) from the reference text

- Convenience methods for graph density and for reversing a directed graph
  (I took a look at the C++ version manual and they don't exist there either)

- A python egg to be able to install the module locally (like with
  easy_install --user with pypi packages)

- Build a graph from numpy edge list

- Support cmake build system

- Implement a method in TNEANet to return a list of edges between two nodes

- Implement a method in all graph types to return the graph adjacency matrix as a sparse matrix

- Implement a method in all graph types to return the graph incidence matrix as a sparse matrix
