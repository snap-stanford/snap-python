Multimodal Networks
````````````````````

Multimodal networks in SNAP are represented by :class:`TMMNet`, which consist of modes, which are of class :class:`TModeNet`, and the links between them, which are of class :class:`TCrossNet`.

The idea is that a multimodal network is a heterogeneous network where each node belongs to a particular mode, and edges belong to a particular cross net (that is, a particular kind of interaction between two modes). For example, in a biological dataset, genes, diseases and drugs might be the modes, and disease-disease interactions, disease-gene interactions and gene-drug interactions might be the links, or crossnets. To represent this in SNAP, we would build a :class:`TModeNet` for each mode -- each :class:`TModeNet` would contain only the nodes belonging to that mode. Next, we would build a :class:`TCrossNet` for every kind of link between modes. All edges should be added to the appropriate :class:`TCrossNet`. Note that there can be a :class:`TCrossNet` for links from the same mode to itself, and that there can be multiple :class:`TCrossNet` objects linking the same pair of modes (for example, in a multimodal social network dataset with a mode corresponding to users, and another corresponding to photos, there can be one :class:`TCrossNet` connecting users to photos they took, and another connecting users to photos they are tagged in).

The :class:`TMMNet` class allows the construction of such multimodal networks in a modular fashion -- the user adds the corresponding instances of :class:`TModeNet`, specifying a name for each mode, and then adds the edges by adding instances of :class:`TCrossNet`, specifying the name of the cross net and the modes which it links. (:class:`TCrossNet` supports both undirected and directed multi-edges.)

MMNets can be loaded from a :class:`TTable`, using functions :func:`LoadModeNetToNet` and :func:`LoadCrossNetToNet`.

A :class:`TMMNet` can also be converted into a :class:`TNEANet`, using the :meth:`~multimodal.TMMNet.ToNetwork` method (documented below), after which all the SNAP algorithms that work on regular networks can be run on it. The method allows us to specify exactly which crossnets we want to include in the network, so that we can simply pull out the subgraph of interest to us.

The following code shows example usage of :class:`TMMNet` to construct a toy multimodal network. (All the methods used in this example are documented in detail below.) ::

    import snap
    
    mmnet = snap.TMMNet.New()

    # Create a new modenet
    mmnet.AddModeNet("TestMode1")

    # Add a crossnet which has directed links from TestMode1 to itself.
    mmnet.AddCrossNet("TestMode1", "TestMode1", "TestCross1", snap.TBool(True))

    # Add a crossnet which has undirected links from TestMode1 to itself.
    mmnet.AddCrossNet("TestMode1", "TestMode1", "TestCross2", snap.TBool(False))

    # Add a second mode
    mmnet.AddModeNet("TestMode2")

    # Add a directed, and then an undirected crossnet from TestMode1 to TestMode2.
    mmnet.AddCrossNet("TestMode1", "TestMode2", "TestCross3", snap.TBool(True))   
    mmnet.AddCrossNet("TestMode1", "TestMode2", "TestCross4", snap.TBool(False))   

    # Get the mode net objects, and add nodes to them.
    modenet1 = mmnet.GetModeNetByName("TestMode1")
    modenet2 = mmnet.GetModeNetByName("TestMode2")
    for i in range(1000):
        modenet1.AddNode(i)
        modenet2.AddNode(i*2)
    
    # Get the cross net objects, and add edges to them.
    crossnet1 = mmnet.GetCrossNetByName("TestCross1")
    crossnet2 = mmnet.GetCrossNetByName("TestCross2")
    crossnet3 = mmnet.GetCrossNetByName("TestCross3")
    crossnet4 = mmnet.GetCrossNetByName("TestCross4")
    for i in range(1000):
        crossnet1.AddEdge(i, (i+1)%1000, i)
        crossnet2.AddEdge((i+5)%1000, i, i)
        crossnet3.AddEdge(i, (i%1000)*2, i)
        crossnet4.AddEdge((i+5)%1000, (i%1000)*2, i)

    # Iterate over modes
    modeneti = mmnet.BegModeNetI()
    while modeneti < mmnet.EndModeNetI():
        print(modeneti.GetModeName())
        modeneti.Next()

    # Iterate over crossnets
    crossneti = mmnet.BegCrossNetI()
    while crossneti < mmnet.EndCrossNetI():
        print(crossneti.GetCrossName())
        crossneti.Next()

    # Get a subgraph
    crossnets = snap.TStrV()
    crossnets.add("TestCross1")
    sub_mmnet = mmnet.GetSubgraphByCrossNet(crossnets)

    # Convert to TNEANet

    crossnetids = snap.TIntV()
    crossnetids.Add(mmnet.GetCrossId("TestCross1"))
    crossnetids.Add(mmnet.GetCrossId("TestCross2"))
    crossnetids.Add(mmnet.GetCrossId("TestCross3"))

    # These are mappings consisting of triples of (modeid, old attribute name, new attribute name)
    nodeattrmapping = snap.TIntStrStrTrV()
    edgeattrmapping = snap.TIntStrStrTrV()
    
    pneanet = mmnet.ToNetwork(crossnetids, nodeattrmapping, edgeattrmapping)

TModeNet
=========

.. class:: TModeNet()
           TModeNet(ModeId)
           TModeNet(Nodes, Edges)
           TModeNet(Nodes, Edges, ModeId)
           TModeNet(Graph)

   Returns a new directed multigraph with node and edge attributes that represents
   a mode in a :class:`TMMNet`.
   If no parameters are provided,
   an empty graph is created. If *Nodes* and *Edges* are specified, space
   is preallocated for *Nodes* nodes and *Edges* edges. If *Graph* is specified,
   the new graph is a copy of the input graph. *ModeId* provides the integer id
   for the mode the :class:`TModeNet` represents.

   In general, a :class:`TModeNet` should not be created directly and instead should
   be added to a multimodal network using the :class:`TMMNet` method :meth:`AddModeNet`.

   :class:`TModeNet` inherits from :class:`TNEANet` and therefore has all
   the same methods. In addition, it has the following multimodal related functions:

     .. describe:: GetCrossNetNames(Names)

        Gets a list of CrossNets that have this Mode as either a source or destination type.

     .. describe:: GetNeighborsByCrossNet(NId, Name, Neighbors, isOutEId=False)

        For the given node with id *NId*, gets all the neighbors for crossnet type with
        name *Name*. If this mode is both the source and dest type, the flag *isOutEId*
        specifies direction.

     .. describe:: BegMMNI(SIn)

        Returns an iterator referring to the first node in the graph.

     .. describe:: EndMMNI(SOut)

        Returns an iterator referring to the past-the-end node in the graph.

        Returns an iterator referring to the node of ID NId in the graph.


TModeNetNodeI

.. class:: TModeNetNodeI()

    Returns a new node iterator for :class:`TModeNet`. Normally, these
    objects are not created directly,
    but obtained via a call to the network class :class:`TModeNet` method,
    such as :meth:`BegMMNI()`, that returns a node iterator.

    :class:`TModeNetNodeI` provides the following methods:

      .. describe:: Next()

        Moves the iterator to the next node in the graph.

      .. describe:: IsNbrNId(NId)

        Tests whether node with ID *NId* is a neighbor of the current node.

     .. describe:: GetCrossNetNames(Names)

        Gets a list of CrossNets that include the mode this node belongs to as either a
        source or destination type.

     .. describe:: GetNeighborsByCrossNet(Name, Neighbors, isOutEId=False)

        For the given node, gets all the neighbors for crossnet type with name *Name*. If
        this mode is both the source and dest type, the flag *isOutEId* specifies direction.



TCrossNet
==========

.. class:: TCrossNet()
           TCrossNet(SrcModeId, DstModeId, CrossNetId)
           TCrossNet(SrcModeId, DstModeId, IsDir, CrossNetId)
           TCrossNet(Graph)

   Returns a new crossnet, which consists of the edges between two different modes
   in a multimodal network. If no parameters are provided, an empty crossnet is created.
   *SrcModeId* and *DstModeId* provide the ids for the source and destination mode id.
   *IsDir* indicates whether the edges in the crossnet are directed. *CrossNetId*
   gives the id for this crossnet. If *Graph* is specified,
   the new crossnet is a copy of the input crossnet.

   A :class:`TCrossNet` should not be created directly and instead should
   be added to a multimodal network using the :class:`TMMNet` method :meth:`AddCrossNet`.

   Methods for :class:`TCrossNet` are presented in two groups. The first
   group of methods deal with graph structure which includes edges.
   The second group of methods deal with edge attributes.

   :class:`TCrossNet` provides iterators for fast traversal of edges
   and attributes.
   Iterator classes are
   :class:`TCrossNetEdgeI` for iterating over edges, and
   :class:`TCrossNetAIntI`, :class:`TCrossNetAFltI`, :class:`TCrossNetAStrI`
   for iterating over integer, float or string attributes, respectively.

   :class:`TCrossNet` methods for graph structure are the following:

        to the crossnet. Returns the ID of the edge being added. If *EId* is -1,
        edge ID is automatically assigned. Throws an exception, if an edge
        with ID *EId* already exists or if either *SrcNId* or *DstNId* does
        not exist.

     .. describe:: GetMode2()

        Returns the id of the destination mode.

     .. describe:: IsDirected()

        Returns whether edges in the crossnet are directed.

   Modes have user-specified names and SNAP-assigned integer IDs, which are
   arbitrary non-negative integers. Cross-nets, which store the edges between
   two modes, also have user-specified names and SNAP-assigned integer IDs. Cross-nets
   are, by default, directed but can also be undirected. The same source mode can be
   used as the destination mode for a given cross-net. 

   :class:`TMMNet` provides iterators for fast traversal of modes and cross-nets.
   Iterator classes are :class:`TMMNetModeNetI` for iterating over modes and

        are directed.

     .. describe:: DelCrossNet(CrossId)
                   DelCrossNet(CrossName)

        Deletes the crossnet with id *CrossId* or name *CrossName*, respectively, from the

        the crossnets (and corresponding modenets) whose ids are specified in the vector of integer ids, CrossNetTypes.

        As attribute names can collide (since different modes can have the same attribute name in a TMMNet, but can't
        anymore once it is converted to a TNEANet), two attribute maps are passed, one for modes and one for crossnets.
        Each attribute map is passed as a vector of triples. Each triple has the mode id, the attribute name in the
        TMMNet, and the attribute name to be used in the newly created TNEANet.
