class Graph:
    """
    Base class for undirected graphs, much like the "Graph" class in NetworkX.

    DESIGN NOTES:
    1) Use of TNEANet and its consequences:
    This class is built on top of TNEANet, a multigraph implemented in C++ SNAP.
    For that reason, some of the behaviors expected out of an undirected graph
    are emulated in this layer. More specifically, we did the following:
    - When an edge (u, v) is added, both (u, v) and (v, u) get registered
      to the underlying TNEANet.
    - We keep a counter 'self._num_edges' to track how many edges exist in
      the graph.

    We currently rely on TNEANet due to its rich support for node and edge
    attributes. A future implementation may obviate the need for this emulation
    by expanding the C++ SNAP's undirected graph to provide support for such
    attributes.

    2) How graph/node/edge attributes are stored
    - Graph attributes: Stored in self.graph, a built-in dict.
    - Node and edge attributes:
        - An int typed attribute gets stored in the TNEANet's feature storage.
        - All other types will go to the extra attribute builtin dicts
          (self._node_extra_attr and self._edge_extra_attr).
        AttributeDict handles manipulation of edge/node features.

    Docstrings are mostly copied over from NetworkX for reference, and thus may not
    accurately reflect the exact features supported in SnapX.

        Notes
        -----
        If your node data is not needed, it is simpler and equivalent
        to use the expression ``for n in G``, or ``list(G)``.
        Examples
        --------
        There are two simple ways of getting a list of all nodes in the graph:
        >>> G = nx.path_graph(3)
        >>> list(G.nodes)
        [0, 1, 2]
        >>> list(G)
        [0, 1, 2]
        To get the node data along with the nodes:
        >>> G.add_node(1, time='5pm')
        >>> G.nodes[0]['foo'] = 'bar'
        >>> list(G.nodes(data=True))
        [(0, {'foo': 'bar'}), (1, {'time': '5pm'}), (2, {})]
        >>> list(G.nodes.data())
        [(0, {'foo': 'bar'}), (1, {'time': '5pm'}), (2, {})]
        >>> list(G.nodes(data='foo'))
        [(0, 'bar'), (1, None), (2, None)]
        >>> list(G.nodes.data('foo'))
        [(0, 'bar'), (1, None), (2, None)]
        >>> list(G.nodes(data='time'))
        [(0, None), (1, '5pm'), (2, None)]
        >>> list(G.nodes.data('time'))
        [(0, None), (1, '5pm'), (2, None)]
        >>> list(G.nodes(data='time', default='Not Available'))
        [(0, 'Not Available'), (1, '5pm'), (2, 'Not Available')]
        >>> list(G.nodes.data('time', default='Not Available'))
        [(0, 'Not Available'), (1, '5pm'), (2, 'Not Available')]
        If some of your nodes have an attribute and the rest are assumed
        to have a default attribute value you can create a dictionary
        from node/attribute pairs using the `default` keyword argument
        to guarantee the value is never None::
            >>> G = nx.Graph()

        Like dict.update, this method takes a graph as input, adding the

        edges and nodes. Finally it can take either edges or nodes.

        should yield 2-tuples (u, v) or 3-tuples (u, v, datadict).
        Parameters

        edges : Graph object, collection of edges, or None
            The first parameter can be a graph or some edges. If it has
            attributes `nodes` and `edges`, then it is taken to be a
            Graph-like object and those attributes are used as collections
            of nodes and edges to be added to the graph.
            If the first parameter does not have those attributes, it is
            treated as a collection of edges and added to the graph.
            If the first argument is None, no edges are added.
        nodes : collection of nodes, or None
            The second parameter is treated as a collection of nodes
            to be added to the graph unless it is None.
            If `edges is None` and `nodes is None` an exception is raised.
            If the first parameter is a Graph, then `nodes` is ignored.
        Examples
        --------

        Returns
        -------
        edges : EdgeView
            A view of edge attributes, usually it iterates over (u, v)
            or (u, v, d) tuples of edges, but can also be used for
            attribute lookup as `edges[u, v]['foo']`.

        Nodes in nbunch that are not in the graph will be (quietly) ignored.

        The copy method by default returns an independent shallow copy
        of the graph and attributes. That is, if an attribute is a
        container, that container is shared by the original an the copy.
        Use Python's `copy.deepcopy` for new containers.
        If `as_view` is True then a view is returned instead of a copy.
        Notes
        -----
        All copies reproduce the graph structure, but data attributes
        may be handled in different ways. There are four types of copies
        of a graph that people might want.
        Deepcopy -- A "deepcopy" copies the graph structure as well as
        all data attributes and any objects they might contain.
        The entire graph object is new so that changes in the copy
        do not affect the original object. (see Python's copy.deepcopy)
        Data Reference (Shallow) -- For a shallow copy the graph structure
        is copied but the edge, node and graph attribute dicts are
        references to those in the original graph. This saves
        time and memory but could cause confusion if you change an attribute
        in one graph and it changes the attribute in the other.
        NetworkX does not provide this level of shallow copy.
        Independent Shallow -- This copy creates new independent attribute
        dicts and then does a shallow copy of the attributes. That is, any
        attributes that are containers are shared between the new graph
        and the original. This is exactly what `dict.copy()` provides.
        You can obtain this style copy using:
            >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
            >>> H = G.copy()
            >>> H = G.copy(as_view=False)
            >>> H = nx.Graph(G)
            >>> H = G.__class__(G)
        Fresh Data -- For fresh data, the graph structure is copied while
        new empty data attribute dicts are created. The resulting graph
        is independent of the original and it has no edge, node or graph
        attributes. Fresh copies are not enabled. Instead use:
            >>> H = G.__class__()
            >>> H.add_nodes_from(G)
            >>> H.add_edges_from(G.edges)
        View -- Inspired by dict-views, graph-views act like read-only
        versions of the original graph, providing a copy of the original
        structure without requiring any memory for copying the information.
        See the Python copy module for more information on shallow
        and deep copies, https://docs.python.org/2/library/copy.html.
        Parameters
        ----------
        as_view : bool, optional (default=False)
            If True, the returned graph-view provides a read-only view
            of the original graph without actually copying any data.

        Parameters

        Notes
        -----
        The graph, edge and node attributes are shared with the original graph.
        Changes to the graph structure is ruled out by the view, but changes
        to attributes are reflected in the original graph.
        To create a subgraph with its own copy of the edge/node attributes use:
        G.subgraph(nodes).copy()
        For an inplace reduction of a graph to a subgraph you can remove nodes:
        G.remove_nodes_from([n for n in G if n not in set(nodes)])
        Subgraph views are sometimes NOT what you want. In most cases where
        you want to do more than simply look at the induced edges, it makes
        more sense to just create the subgraph as its own graph with code like:
        ::

            SG = G.__class__()
